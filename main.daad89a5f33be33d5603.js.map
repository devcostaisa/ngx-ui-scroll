ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hooks (depending on the node\n// flags in lifecycle). Unlike ngDoCheck, ngOnChanges and ngOnInit, which are\n// called during a pre-order traversal of the view tree (that is calling the\n// parent hooks before the child hooks) these events are sent in using a\n// post-order traversal of the tree (children before parents). This changes the\n// meaning of initIndex in the view state. For ngOnInit, initIndex tracks the\n// expected nodeIndex which a ngOnInit should be called. When sending\n// ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit it is the expected count of\n// ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit methods that have been called. This\n// ensure that despite being called recursively or after picking up after an\n// exception, the ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit will be called on the\n// correct nodes. Consider for example, the following (where E is an element\n// and D is a directive)\n//  Tree:       pre-order index  post-order index\n//    E1        0                6\n//      E2      1                1\n//       D3     2                0\n//      E4      3                5\n//       E5     4                4\n//        E6    5                2\n//        E7    6                3\n// As can be seen, the post-order index has an unclear relationship to the\n// pre-order index (postOrderIndex === preOrderIndex - parentCount +\n// childCount). Since number of calls to ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit\n// are stable (will be the same for the same view regardless of exceptions or\n// recursion) we just need to count them which will roughly correspond to the\n// post-order index (it skips elements and directives that do not have\n// lifecycle hooks).\n//\n// For example, if an exception is raised in the E6.onAfterViewInit() the\n// initIndex is left at 3 (by shouldCallLifecycleInitHook() which set it to\n// initIndex + 1). When checkAndUpdateView() is called again D3, E2 and E6 will\n// not have their ngAfterViewInit() called but, starting with E7, the rest of\n// the view will begin getting ngAfterViewInit() called until a check and\n// pass is complete.\n//\n// This algorthim also handles recursion. Consider if E4's ngAfterViewInit()\n// indirectly calls E1's ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges().

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run.

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * ### Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * ### Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * ### Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in following example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * @ngModule CommonModule\n * @publicApi\n */\nvar NgIf = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function NgIf(_viewContainer, templateRef) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._context = new NgIfContext();\n        this._thenTemplateRef = null;\n        this._elseTemplateRef = null;\n        this._thenViewRef = null;\n        this._elseViewRef = null;\n        this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIf\", {\n        set: function (condition) {\n            this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfThen\", {\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            assertTemplate('ngIfThen', templateRef);\n            this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._thenViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfElse\", {\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            assertTemplate('ngIfElse', templateRef);\n            this._elseTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._elseViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    NgIf.prototype._updateView = function () {\n        if (this._context.$implicit) {\n            if (!this._thenViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._elseViewRef = null;\n                if (this._thenTemplateRef) {\n                    this._thenViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._thenTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            if (!this._elseViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._thenViewRef = null;\n                if (this._elseTemplateRef) {\n                    this._elseViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._elseTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * Assert the correct type of the expression bound to the `ngIf` input within the template.\n     *\n     * The presence of this method is a signal to the Ivy template type check compiler that when the\n     * `NgIf` structural directive renders its template, the type of the expression bound to `ngIf`\n     * should be narrowed in some way.

* Note that timezone correction is not applied to an ISO string that has no time component, such as \"2016-09-19\"\n *\n * ### Format examples\n *\n * These examples transform a date into various formats,\n * assuming that `dateObj` is a JavaScript `Date` object for\n * year: 2015, month: 6, day: 15, hour: 21, minute: 43, second: 11,\n * given in the local time for the `en-US` locale.\n *\n * ```\n * {{ dateObj | date }}               // output is 'Jun 15, 2015'\n * {{ dateObj | date:'medium' }}      // output is 'Jun 15, 2015, 9:43:11 PM'\n * {{ dateObj | date:'shortTime' }}   // output is '9:43 PM'\n * {{ dateObj | date:'mmss' }}        // output is '43:11'\n * ```\n *\n * ### Usage example\n *\n * The following component uses a date pipe to display the current date in different formats.\n *\n * ```\n * @Component({\n *  selector: 'date-pipe',\n *  template: `<div>\n *    <p>Today is {{today | date}}</p>\n *    <p>Or if you prefer, {{today | date:'fullDate'}}</p>\n *    <p>The time is {{today | date:'h:mm a z'}}</p>\n *  </div>`\n * })\n * // Get the current date and time as a date-time value.\n * export class DatePipeComponent {\n *   today: number = Date.now();\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\n// clang-format on\nvar DatePipe = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function DatePipe(locale) {\n        this.locale = locale;\n    }\n    DatePipe_1 = DatePipe;\n

It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const selectedCountriesControl = new FormControl();\n * ```\n *\n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [formControl]=\"selectedCountriesControl\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * **Note:** We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * @ngModule ReactiveFormsModule\n * @ngModule FormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * The registered callback function called when a change event occurs on the input element.\n         */\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * The registered callback function called when a blur event occurs on the input element.\n         */\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * Tracks the option comparison algorithm for tracking identities when\n         * checking for changes.\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * Sets the \"value\" property on the input element.

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with `FormControl` and `FormGroup`.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Create an array of form controls\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * ### Create a form array with array-level validators\n *\n * You include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy\n * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child\n * control.\n *\n * The two types of validators are passed in separately as the second and third arg\n * respectively, or together as part of an options object.\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy'),\n *   new FormControl('Drew')\n * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});\n * ```\n *\n  * ### Set the updateOn property for all controls in a form array\n *\n * The options object is used to set a default value for each child\n * control's `updateOn` property.

These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy.

You don't need to add a special selector.\n *\n * You optionally export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key\n * (ex: `#myForm=\"ngForm\"`).

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive also registers itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * This directive is used by itself or as part of a larger form. Use the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional `Input`. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class sets the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI always syncs back to\n * the domain model in your class.\n *\n * To inspect the properties of the associated `FormControl` (like validity state),\n * export the directive into a local template variable using `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`).\n * You then access the control using the directive's `control` property,\n * but most properties used (like `valid` and `dirty`) fall through to the control anyway for direct access.\n * See a full list of properties directly available in `AbstractControlDirective`.\n *\n * @see `RadioControlValueAccessor`\n * @see `SelectControlValueAccessor`\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * ### Using ngModel on a standalone control\n *\n * The following examples show a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * In the context of a parent form, it's often unnecessary to include one-way or two-way binding,\n * as the parent form syncs the value for you. You access its properties by exporting it into a\n * local template variable using `ngForm` such as (`#f=\"ngForm\"`). Use the variable where\n * needed on form submission.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * ### Using ngModel within a form\n *\n * The following example shows controls using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Using a standalone ngModel within a group\n *\n * The following example shows you how to use a standalone ngModel control\n * within a form.

The name attribute is used\n * within a custom form component, and the name `@Input` property serves a different purpose.\n *\n * ```html\n * <form>\n *   <my-person-control name=\"Nancy\" ngModel [ngModelOptions]=\"{name: 'user'}\">\n *   </my-person-control>\n * </form>\n * <!-- form value: {user: ''} -->\n * ```\n *\n * @ngModule FormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\nvar NgModel = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this.control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        _this._registered = false;\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * Event emitter for producing the `ngModelChange` event after\n         * the view model updates.\n         */\n        _this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        _this._parent = parent;\n        _this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        _this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        _this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(_this, valueAccessors);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @description\n     * A lifecycle method called when the directive's inputs change.

First, developers have found this pattern\n * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's\n * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply\n * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value\n * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like\n * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,\n * which has understandably caused some confusion.\n *\n * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which\n * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of\n * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic\n * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in\n * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.\n *\n * To update your code before v7, you'll want to decide whether to stick with reactive form\n * directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to\n * template-driven directives.\n *\n * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <input [formControl]=\"control\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.control.setValue('some value');\n * ```\n *\n * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <input [(ngModel)]=\"value\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.value = 'some value';\n * ```\n *\n * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev\n * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for\n * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:\n *\n * ```ts\n * imports: [\n *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});\n * ]\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this\n * pattern with a config value of `\"always\"`.

First, developers have found this pattern\n * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's\n * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply\n * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value\n * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like\n * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,\n * which has understandably caused some confusion.\n *\n * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which\n * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of\n * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic\n * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in\n * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.\n *\n * To update your code before v7, you'll want to decide whether to stick with reactive form\n * directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to\n * template-driven directives.\n *\n * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <form [formGroup]=\"form\">\n *   <input formControlName=\"first\">\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.form.get('first').setValue('some value');\n * ```\n *\n * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <input [(ngModel)]=\"value\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.value = 'some value';\n * ```\n *\n * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev\n * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for\n * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:\n *\n * ```ts\n * imports: [\n *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});\n * ]\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this\n * pattern with a config value of `\"always\"`. This may help to track down where in the code\n * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.\n *\n * @ngModule ReactiveFormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\nvar FormControlName = /** @class */ (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControlName, _super);\n    function FormControlName(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors, _ngModelWarningConfig) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this._ngModelWarningConfig = _ngModelWarningConfig;\n        _this._added = false;\n        /** @deprecated as of v6 */\n        _this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        /**\n         * @description\n         * Instance property used to track whether an ngModel warning has been sent out for this\n         * particular FormControlName instance.
