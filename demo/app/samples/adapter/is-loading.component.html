    The uiScroll is {{datasource.adapter.isLoading ? 'loading': 'relaxing'}}.
    <br>
    The value of isLoading counter has been changed for {{isLoadingCounter}} times.
  </div>
  <div description>
    <p>
      The first <em>Adapter</em> read-only property we want to use is called <em>isLoading</em>.
      It is a boolean value indicating whether there are any pending processes running by the <em>uiScroll</em>.
      So when <em>datasource.adapter.isLoading</em> is <em>true</em>, it means that
      the <em>uiScroll</em> is working right now and the viewport might be updated soon.
      125ms delay was added to the <em>Datasource.get</em> implementation in this sample.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to read-only scalar <em>isLoading</em> property there is also
      <em>isLoading$</em> property which is Observable. A Subject, to be exact.
      In this demo we have a subscription and <em>isLoadingCounter</em>
      incrementing each time the <em>isLoading</em> becomes <em>false</em>.
      We see that the initial value of this counter on the UI (before any scrolling) is 1.
      So the <em>uiScroll</em> does initialization and first 3 fetches in a single session.
